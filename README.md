# Shiny app: mi-spcr simulation results dashboard

This is a repository to host the `ui.R` and `server.R` and input file required by a shiny dashboard to dynamically sort through the results of the simulation study performed [here](https://github.com/EdoardoCostantini/mi-spcr)

You may download this repository to build the app locally, or go [here](https://edoardocostantini.github.io/publication/mi-super-pcr/) to look at it.
